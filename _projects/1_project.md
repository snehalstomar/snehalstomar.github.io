Project Mentors: [Prof. Kaushik Mitra](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/kmitra/) and [Mohit Lamba](https://mohitlamba94.github.io/about-me/), Teammates: [Subhankar Chakraborty](https://in.linkedin.com/in/subhankarchakrabortyiitm) and [Aqil KH](https://in.linkedin.com/in/aqil-k-h-558452146)



The objective of this project was to do away with the preprocessing and rectification pipeline used by the [L3FNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02438) and train a Deep Network with a similar architecture to peroform low-light restoration of raw light field data captured using a Lytro camera (see [L3F dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Yq4m9t1WwlvxeBOvK35PtMmqZnjy_MEQ)).
