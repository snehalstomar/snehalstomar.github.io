I am a second year MS (by Research) student in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/). I am a part of the Image Processing and Computer Vision ([IPCV](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ipcvlab/)) Lab and am grateful for being advised by <span class="nowrap">
[Prof. A.N. Rajagopalan](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/raju/)</span>. My research interests are in Computer Vision and Deep Learning. My focus thus far, has been to build interpretable generative models for downstream tasks. I am supported by Ministry of Education, Govt. of India through a Half Time Research Assistantship (HTRA).

As an undergrad, I did several research internships with [Prof. Shubhendu Bhasin](http://web.iitd.ac.in/~sbhasin/) at [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/), working in the domain of Control Systems and Robotics. I was also a part of my university's [AI Robotics Team](http://projectmanas.in/), where we worked on building an autonomous car.
